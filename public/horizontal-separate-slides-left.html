                    <p class="p-small">First slideshows were invented in early 1600s, when hand-painted pictures on a piece of glass were first projected onto a wall using "magic lantern". Sunlight, candles and oil lamps were the only available light sources. The development of light bulbs opened up a world of practical applications for image projection.</p>

                    <p class="p-small">In the 1800s, a series of hand-painted glass "lantern slides" was sometimes projected to illustrate story-telling or a lecture. By 1900, hand-painted images on glass had been replaced by photographic images, but they still needed to be colorized manually.</p>

                    <p class="p-small">After 35 mm Kodachrome color film was introduced in 1936, a new standard 2×2 inch (5×5 cm) miniature lantern slide format was created to better suit the very small transparencies the film produced. In advertising, the antique "magic lantern" terminology was streamlined, so that the framed pieces of film were simply "slides" and the lantern used to project them was a "slide projector".</p>

                    <p class="p-small">A filmstrip (diafilm) is a spooled roll of 35 mm positive film with approximately thirty to fifty images arranged in sequential order. In USSR, diafilms was the most affordable show. Every soviet family could afford to buy a filmstrip projector. There were a lot of soviet diafilms with fairytales and literary works.</p>
